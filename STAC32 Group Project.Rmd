# 0. Read the datasets
```{r}
breed_traits <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-02-01/breed_traits.csv')
breed_traits
```

As the origin breed_traits table has column names with space between each word, which makes it difficult to call in R, `make.names()` makes syntactically valid names out of character vectors (Source: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10688137/how-to-fix-spaces-in-column-names-of-a-data-frame-remove-spaces-inject-dots). 
```{r}
names(breed_traits)<-make.names(names(breed_traits),unique = TRUE)
breed_traits
```
As we navigate through each trait, we came across the question that whether some traits can affect another. Thus, we roughly divided the traits into 3 categories:

1. Affection level: Affectionate With Family, Good With Young Children, Good With Other Dogs
2. Appearance: Shedding Level, Coat Grooming Frequency, Drooling Level, Coat Type, Coat Length
3. Personality: Openness To Strangers, Playfulness Level, Watchdog/Protective Nature, Adaptability Level, Trainability Level, Energy Level, Barking Level, Mental Stimulation Needs

In this section, we are focusing on whether breeds' personality can affect their affection level. Specifically, we look at whether personality can affect their affection level with family and young children.

# 1. Affectionate With Family vs. Personality Traits

## Plotting response "Affectionate.With.Family" against every personality traits
```{r}
breed_traits %>%
  pivot_longer(Openness.To.Strangers:Mental.Stimulation.Needs,
               names_to="xname", values_to="x", values_drop_na = T) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = Affectionate.With.Family)) + geom_jitter() +
  facet_wrap(~xname, scales = "free") -> g
g
```

## Multiple regression model formula
```{r}
a.1 <- lm(Affectionate.With.Family ~ Openness.To.Strangers + Playfulness.Level + Watchdog.Protective.Nature + Adaptability.Level + Trainability.Level + Energy.Level + Barking.Level + Mental.Stimulation.Needs, data=breed_traits)
glance(a.1)
tidy(a.1) %>% arrange(p.value)
```


## Residual plot of residuals against fitted values
```{r}
ggplot(a.1, aes(x = .fitted, y = .resid)) + geom_point()
```

## Residual plots of residuals against each explanatory
```{r}
a.1 %>% augment(breed_traits) ->a.1a
a.1a %>%
pivot_longer(
Openness.To.Strangers:Mental.Stimulation.Needs,
names_to="xname", values_to="x"
) %>%
ggplot(aes(x = x, y = .resid)) +
geom_jitter() + facet_wrap(~xname, scales = "free") -> g1
g1
```
Every plot look great enough, suggesting no transformation of y is needed.




## Taking out variables one by one
```{r}
tidy(a.1) %>% arrange(p.value)
a.2 <- update(a.1, .~. -Trainability.Level)
tidy(a.2) %>% arrange(p.value)
a.3 <- update(a.2, .~. -Barking.Level)
tidy(a.3) %>% arrange(p.value)
a.4 <- update(a.3, .~. -Playfulness.Level)
tidy(a.4) %>% arrange(p.value)
a.5 <- update(a.4, .~. -Energy.Level)
tidy(a.5) %>% arrange(p.value)
```

## Revisit the best model
Check that removing all other variables wasn't too much:
```{r}
anova(a.5, a.1)
```
𝐻_0: two models equally good; 𝐻_𝑎: bigger model better.
Null not rejected here; small model as good as the big one, so prefer simpler smaller model a.5.


```{r}
tidy(a.5)
```

Regression slopes suggest that Affectionate With Family increases as `Openness To Strangers` increases, `Watchdog Protective Nature` increases, `Adaptability Level` increases, and `Mental Stimulation Needs` increases. 

## Check the residual plots for our best model
```{r}
augment(a.5, breed_traits) %>%
pivot_longer(
Openness.To.Strangers:Mental.Stimulation.Needs,
names_to="xname", values_to="x",
) %>%
ggplot(aes(y = .resid, x = x)) + geom_jitter() +
facet_wrap(~xname, scales = "free") -> g3
g3
```
None of the plots show any sort of pattern. The points all look random on each plot.
There is one low outlier (0) for each plot except `Barking Level`. 




# 2. Good With Young Children vs. Personality Traits

## Plotting response "Good.With.Young.Children" against every personality traits
```{r}
breed_traits %>%
  pivot_longer(Openness.To.Strangers:Mental.Stimulation.Needs,
               names_to="xname", values_to="x", values_drop_na = T) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = Good.With.Young.Children)) + geom_jitter() +
  facet_wrap(~xname, scales = "free") -> g
g
```

## Multiple regression model formula
```{r}
b.1 <- lm(Good.With.Young.Children ~ Openness.To.Strangers + Playfulness.Level + Watchdog.Protective.Nature + Adaptability.Level + Trainability.Level + Energy.Level + Barking.Level + Mental.Stimulation.Needs, data=breed_traits)
glance(b.1)
tidy(b.1) %>% arrange(p.value)
```


## Residual plot of residuals against fitted values
```{r}
ggplot(b.1, aes(x = .fitted, y = .resid)) + geom_point()
```

## Residual plots of residuals against each explanatory
```{r}
b.1 %>% augment(breed_traits) ->b.1a
b.1a %>%
pivot_longer(
Openness.To.Strangers:Mental.Stimulation.Needs,
names_to="xname", values_to="x"
) %>%
ggplot(aes(x = x, y = .resid)) +
geom_jitter() + facet_wrap(~xname, scales = "free") -> g1
g1
```

tidy(b.3) %>% arrange(p.value)

tidy(b.4) %>% arrange(p.value)
b.5 <- update(b.4, .~. -Trainability.Level)
tidy(b.5) %>% arrange(p.value)

tidy(b.6) %>% arrange(p.value)
b.7 <- update(b.6, .~. -Playfulness.Level)
tidy(b.7) %>% arrange(p.value)
```

## Revisit the best model
Check that removing all other variables wasn't too much:
```{r}
anova(b.7, b.1)
```
𝐻_0: two models equally good; 𝐻_𝑎: bigger model better.
Null not rejected here; small model as good as the big one, so prefer simpler smaller model a.5.


```{r}
tidy(b.7)
```

Regression slopes suggest that Good With Young Children increases as `Openness To Strangers` increases, and `Adaptability Level` increases.
